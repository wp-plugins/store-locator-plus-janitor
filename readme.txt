= Description Decoding =

Prior versions of Store Locator Plus may have encoded HTML while storing the data in the location descriptions.
A one-time-use tool will repair the location descriptions, converting the HTML encoded data to standard HTML
notation.   If you are seeing text such as &lt;br/&gt; instead of <br/> in your description data, you need this tool.
